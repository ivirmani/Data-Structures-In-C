#2. Priority queue using arrays. 

#3. Singly Linked List with the following operations:
a. Inserting a node( Any desired position)
b. Deleting a node (Any desired position)
c. Display 

#4. Circular Linked List with the following operations:
a. Inserting a node( Any desired position)
b. Deleting a node (Any desired position)
c. Display 

#5. Doubly Linked List with the following operations:
a. Inserting a node( Any desired position)
b. Deleting a node (Any desired position)
c. Display 

#6. Represent and evaluate a given Polynomial using Singly Linked List. 

#7. To check if a Singly Linked List is a Palindrome or not.

#8. To insert a given element into an ordered Doubly Linked List.

#9. To delete every second node from Singly Linked list.

#10. Binary Tree operations:
a. Creation
b. Traversal(Inorder, Preorder and Postorder)

#11. Creation of Expression tree and evaluate it.

#12. Replace each node in binary tree with the sum of its inorder predecessor and successor.
